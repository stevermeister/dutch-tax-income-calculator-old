Dutch Tax Income Calculator with AngularJS (*now with mobile verions)


**About the application**
					
Once I came to conclusion that salary calculations took much time. I'd tried to find online tool but fould
only spreadsheet that did not work for me.


Being AngularJS lover I decided to spend several hours and create such tool based on this framework. 
A little bit later [@yevgeniyvaleyev](https://github.com/yevgeniyvaleyev) decided to join the project and make it more fancy to use, especially on mobile handsents.
So we took angular-material framework and made design version 2. You are still more than welcome for
propositions.
